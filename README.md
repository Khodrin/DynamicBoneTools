# DynamicBoneTools
This tool was created to improve the Unity editor for the “Dynamic Bone” Plugin created by Will Hong.

It extends the default editor with new copy, paste, export, and import buttons. These enable you to transfer the setting from one component to another but keep the gameobject references relative to the avatar animator.

It also adds a separate window which allows you to export the whole setup for a whole avatar. You can save these settings in a file and send them to other people.

On import, if a reference is not found the user is prompted to fill in the missing references.

This Tool was designed for dynamic bone version 1.2 or higher.
